# Coloors Clone Project

This is based on the coolors.co site that generates random colour palettes. Press space to generate 5
                  random colours, lock in the ones you like until you have a palette to your taste. You can adjust the
                  hue, saturation and luminance of each colour to find the colour you like most. You can also save
                  palettes to local storage so you never forget.
